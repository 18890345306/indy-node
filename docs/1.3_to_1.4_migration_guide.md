# List of broken changes for migration from indy-node 1.3 to 1.4:

-**Another format of REPLY for "WRITE" transactions**. New REPLY format you can see in:
 [REPLY for "WRITE" txns](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/requests.md#reply-structure-for-write-requests).
 The main goal for this changes is to divide data and metadata.

-**Change key of ReqIdrToTxn store**.   For now, ReqIdrToTxn store request from client as a map of:
 (digest) -> (ledger_id<some_delimiter>txn seq_no). Digest is a sha256 hash of (reqId, DID, operation). 
 Also, digest was moved to transaction metadata section.
 
-**Added tag for CLAIM_DEF**. 'TAG' is a part of key for state tree. If this field exist in incoming transaction, then it will be used. If not, then default.  
Full CLAIM_DEF format description you can see in: [CLAIM_DEF](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/transactions.md#claim_def)

-**Migration fom levelDB to RocksDB**. Rocksdb has a native 'seek' methods, more flexible, has snapshots support and works well on Windows.
For now, all of internal node's storage use this db as a default key-value storage.
